## Add new indicators

### Wait time

Triggers initially when an alert condition is met, given a count of unit of time, re-check the condition which lead to alert being generated, if, for the given time, let's say 5 seconds, upon re-checking each second, we consistently observed the conditions leading to alert trigger, then, that alert is quite reliable.

## Combine indicators

### supertrend + mmt

#### supertrend

atr period = 2, source = close, atr multiplier = [1, 1.5]

#### mmt

rsi length = 7

### hhll
